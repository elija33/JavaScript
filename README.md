    What to do in JavaScript
        Store variables
        Set decision points
        Loop
        Reuse code with functions

    In addition
        Get data from the browser.
        Manipulate the DOM that browsers use to create web pages.


                            Variables
        Store data and refer back to it later.

                            Decision Points
        Use control statements to decide which code to run under different circumstances.

                            Looping 
        Avoid writing the same (or similar) code over and over again.
        Determine at runtime how many times you want to run some code.

                            Functions
        Reuse code multiple times, but only write it once.
        Use code from others.

                            Manipulating the DOM
        JavaScript can find, add, and delete elements from the DOM.
        Can also react to mouse clicks, page reloads, and other actions.
